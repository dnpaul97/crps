CRPS Visual Perception Test
============
During my Placement Year, I worked with patients and colleagues on the issues of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS). CRPS presents as chronic, continuous pain and sensory, autonomic, and motor abnormalities affecting one or more extremities. People with CRPS can also show changes in their perception of and attention to the affected body part and sensory information in the affected side of space. 

During my tenure, we created a online visual perception test which looked for these biases in CRPS patients. Participants would focus on a fixation point and a dot would flash on either the left-hand or right-hand side of the fixation point. Patients would then record their response by pressing the corresponding key (associated with the right or left side). We measured the correct-response rate, as well as the time it took for the CRPS to press a key from the dot flash.

However, we only focused on testing participants whose arms had been affected by CRPS. The simulation I have designed in Lab.JS seeks to establish whether CRPS exhibit the same bias laterally, as well as vertically. The simulations consists of a single circle (circle size still needs to change) with a centred dot (still needs to be randomised). Participants would have to drag the dot from randomised position into the centre of the circle. From the coordinates of where participants dragged the dot to, it can be established whether participants exhibit a bias.
We could compare this the the baseline of controls(if ever tested), or the co-ordinates of the centre-position on the circle, 0,0.
